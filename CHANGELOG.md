## Changes in the Google Tag Manager package versions

## 4.1.0 (2020-01-31)

### Removed
* `*.class` parameters for all entities were removed from the dependency injection container.
The entity class names should be used directly, e.g. `'Oro\Bundle\EmailBundle\Entity\Email'`
instead of `'%oro_email.email.entity.class%'` (in service definitions, datagrid config files, placeholders, etc.), and
`\Oro\Bundle\EmailBundle\Entity\Email::class` instead of `$container->getParameter('oro_email.email.entity.class')`
(in PHP code).
